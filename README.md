PyConUY contest
===============
This is a PyConUy contest about developing a library to interface with Expand 
Speaker API.


Why?
===
We use Python in a large portion of our projets and we wanted the PyConUY
attendees to know about it. 


Objective
=========
The objective is simple, create a Python library to ease the usage of
our Restful speaker voice recognition service documented in
[a relative link](docs/api.rst).

The version of this public webservice only supports male/female gender
recognition, so the coding task should not too hard nor lon. 
To ger you started, you can check out the sample -heavily incomplete- client
code at [a relative link](sample/gender.py).


Rules
=====
The rules are simple, you spend a bit of time coding, we got to choose the one
we most like. Only open licensed software is allowed to be used and you can
team up with as many developers as you like.

We watch out for, but not limited to:

* Automated tests.
* How functionally complete the library is.
* The right degree of abstraction.
* Documentation, usage of a framework for this end is a plus.
* PEP8 complaint code.
* Few dependencies
* Reported API bugs thru this repository Issue system. This includes
  documentation errors.


How to participate
==================
Clone this repo and issue a "pull request" before November 10th.


Prize
=====
The prize -besides the glory- is a Lenovo IdeaTab A2107 tablet.
 
We'll make a decision on November 18th and announce the happy winner
right here in this file. 

Just git pull the results.
